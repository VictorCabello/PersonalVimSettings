# Personal Vim Seetings

This repo contains serveral configurations that I use in my work.

To use this repo it is necessary to install the [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plu). The easy way to install it is with the follwing command:

```bash
$ curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
```

After install the vim-plug just copy the corresponding vimrc file to your home as  **~/.vimrc** and finally open a vim instance and runt eh command **:PlugInstall**.


After the previous steps just enjoy :).
